# hello-world: Beginner project scraping and analysing a private facebook group with python

I started this small project with a friend out of a want to start learning some python and also to try and archive the contents of a private facebook i'm in with some friends that we use to share music with each other (primarily youtube links). 

We wanted to have a list of every song that's been posted in the group but this requires hours of scrolling and computer breakdowns due to not being able to filter a search for posts within a specific time period.

Using facebook's graph api access token, facepy and json in python, I've managged to scrape all the song names (link titles) fairly easily, so I'm now planning to scrape some more data like time of post, number of likes, number of comments etc and hopefully venture into some visualisations.

I know this is very basic stuff but I've found it to be a fun project for me because I'm learning a lot and actually ending up with some results that are very useful to me and a few of my friends. 

I think a lot of people have fb groups to share music links with friends and I couldn't find any available code for this precise purpose, so it could be useful for others if they want a quick way to archive the contents of their group!
